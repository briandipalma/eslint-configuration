# ESLint configuration

This is meant to be a base ESLint configuration to be used in greenfield projects.
Certain warnings might be too strict for brownfield projects.
Some warnings can be fixed with code formatting/conversion tools, some cannot.
Those warnings (and developer preferences) can justify deviations from this configuration.

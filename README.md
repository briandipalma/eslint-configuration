# ESLint configuration

This is meant to be a base ESLint configuration to be used in greenfield projects.
Certain warnings might be too strict for brownfield projects.
Some warnings can be fixed with code formatting/conversion tools, some cannot.
Those warnings (and developer preferences) can justify deviations from this configuration.

ESLint is highly configurable, configuring project level rules is one of the bluntest options
that ESLint offers.
